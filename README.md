### This paper proposes a uncertainty-aware dynamic integration framework for Multi-omics  classification.  The framework consists of three modules: deep embedding, confidence prediction, and downstream tasks. The deep embedding module extract key information from multi-Omics data to obtain a low-dimensional feature representation which is used to train downstream tasks. Combined with the deep embedding module, the confidence prediction module is used to dynamically capture the uncertainty of the data. We introduce ``confidNet" to assign a confidence value for each type of omics data, which is used for dynamic integration between multi-Omics. Compared with other integration methods, the proposed method can contain more  crucial biomedical information in the obtained low-dimensional representation.Our framework realizes reliable integration among multiple omics, and it can still achieve high accuracy on small sample data sets. We have verified the effectiveness of the model in a large number of experiments and proved robust to noisy data.
